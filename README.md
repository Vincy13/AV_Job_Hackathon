It is a Classification problem, where we had to classify whether the customer is going to take the premium or not, as 1 and 0. In this we have to submit the probabilities for class 1.  Using my ensembled 3 LightGBM Classifier I was able to score 0.8197 on public leaderboard and 0.8125 on my cross validation.
